<h2 align="left">About Me</h2>

###

<p align="left">
âœ¨ Creating bugs since 2021.<br>
ðŸ“š I'm currently learning Python with the Scrapy framework and web design (you can check out my website for that as well, don't worry about language you can change it with a button that says "Idioma" but not all is already translated because it's kind of hard).<br>
ðŸŽ¯ Goals: Becoming a developer that inspires others especially in developing nations, creating a vibrant community in my city and country, creating also apps for business and soving problems with technology especially AI.<br>
ðŸŽ² Fun fact: I actually use GitHub as a social media platform, reading repositories to inspire myself.

I'm also currently working on creating developer groups in my area to support open-source projects and secure third-party donations to help initiatives grow. The goal is to build a strong developer community in Monterreyâ€”one that contributes to society for free while gaining experience and knowledge.
